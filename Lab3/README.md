# ARTI308 - Lab 3 (EDA)

## Dataset
This dataset contains student-related features such as StudyHours, Attendance, SleepHours, and Assignments.
The target variable is **FinalScore**.

## Problem Type
Regression (predicting FinalScore from input features).

## What I did in EDA
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Inspected the dataset (shape, head, column types).
- Checked missing values and basic statistics.
- Visualized distributions (histograms) and outliers (boxplots).
- Computed correlations and correlation with the target variable.
- Plotted scatter plots between each feature and FinalScore.
- Created a cleaned version of the dataset for analysis (filled missing numeric values using median and categorical using mode).
